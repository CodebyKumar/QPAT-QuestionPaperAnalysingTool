**Key Observations & Reasoning:**

*   **Frequency Matters:** Questions appearing multiple times are highly probable.
*   **Recent is Relevant:**  Questions from 2023 are more indicative of future trends than those from 2021 alone.
*   **Calculation/Application Questions:** Questions that involve calculations (e.g., building trees, discriminant functions, association rule metrics) are consistently popular.  Expect variations on the data, but the *method* will likely be tested.
*   **Definitions & Explanations:**  Expect questions asking you to define key terms and explain concepts, often with examples.
*   **Diagrams:**  Questions that explicitly ask for diagrams (e.g., SVM objective function, data science context) should be prioritized in studying.
*   **Comparison Questions:** Questions asking you to differentiate between two or more methods are highly likely to appear.
